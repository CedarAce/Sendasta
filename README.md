**Sendasta - An Outlook add-in to stop an email accident, no more costly auto-complete mistakes**



Sendasta is a free Microsoft Outlook add-in that notifies you before an email is sent to an unintended recipient. Say good bye to those costly auto-complete mistakes - Sendasta notifies you before it's too late by checking your recipients after you clicked that 'Send' button.

Thousands of emails a day are sent to an unintended recipient. Sensitive information including client information, attachments, IP, strategy, and legal binding document are at risk, with such an easy fix. Sendasta alerts, notifies, or blocks that email before it ends up in the wrong inbox. Our 'Enterprise' version let's you setup custom filters and analytics, we'll help you set it up. What's protecting your business from an email 'slip up'?

**Create your 'no-email' list**: Craft your 'no-email' list to pre-emptively block or alert on emails to domains you have blacklisted, including competitors and personal addresses. Enforce your email policy with precision, protecting your sensitive data from accidental or deliberate exposure.

**Eliminate auto-complete errors**: When your sales team accidentally includes a rival in an email via auto-complete, the fallout is immediate. Confidential strategies exposed, trust eroded. Sendasta prevents these costly errors, keeping your competitive edge and reputation secure.

**Seamless integration**: Simply deploy Sendasta within your Microsoft Admin Center and select the user groups to use it. Admins can use the dashboard to import domain organizations from their CRM (or manually) to a 'no-email' or 'no-combine' list

**Installation Steps**:

Let's get Sendasta in your Outlook, follow along and apologies for the inconvenience, we are still brand new and waiting to get on the official Microsoft AppSource store - for a 'one-click' install. Till then, here are some simple steps to get started, takes 2 mins max!

**1- Download the Sendasta 'install' file:** https://cedarace.github.io/Sendasta/sendasta_install.xml

You can open our settings file (XML) at the link above, then you will need to 'Save-as' this file somewhere you can remember for a minute. This is the file we will point to later one from our inbox.

**2- Import the setting file to your Outlook:**

Sign in to your MS Outlook account, preferably over the web, and navigate to the 'Apps' button in your top menu bar. This looks like a window icon. You will see your current apps, then a 'Get add-ins +' button on the bottom right of that window. Click that.

Psst: Click this link to go directly to the add-in page (as long as your signed in) and skip most of this: https://aka.ms/olksideload

**3- Get the settings file**

Almost there, now on the left pane select the 'My add-ins', then on the bottom of that, you will see the Custom Addins section. Click on '+Add a custom add-in' - Add from file'. You can now select the Sendasta XML file you downloaded in Step 1.

**4- Sendasta controls**

The add-in should now be installed, let's test it out and see how to enable and disable it. Create a new email, then select the 'Apps' button on the top bar, and click on Sendasta. This open the right hand menu bar for the app. You can either set 'Enabled' or 'Disabled' for the entire add-in if you want to bypass it.

**5- Give it a spin!:**

Enter two emails with different domain names (i.e: @test 1.com and @test2.com) give that a try. NOTE: @hotmail, @gmail and @outlook emails are bypassed and the Sendasta will not check them on the free version. Similarly, a domain name from the same organization (@test1.com if you the sender is also @test1.com) will not be included.
