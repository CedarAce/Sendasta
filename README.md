**Sendasta - An Outlook add-in to stop an email accident, no more costly auto-complete mistakes**



Sendasta is a free Microsoft Outlook add-in that notifies you before an email is sent to an unintended recipient. Say good bye to those costly auto-complete mistakes - Sendasta notifies you before it's too late by checking your recipients after you clicked that 'Send' button.

Thousands of emails a day are sent to an unintended recipient. Sensitive information including client information, attachments, IP, strategy, and legal binding document are at risk, with such an easy fix. Sendasta alerts, notifies, or blocks that email before it ends up in the wrong inbox. Our 'Enterprise' version let's you setup custom filters and analytics, we'll help you set it up. What's protecting your business from an email 'slip up'?

**Create your 'no-email' list**: Craft your 'no-email' list to pre-emptively block or alert on emails to domains you have blacklisted, including competitors and personal addresses. Enforce your email policy with precision, protecting your sensitive data from accidental or deliberate exposure.
